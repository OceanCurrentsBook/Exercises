Use the www.plasticadrift.org tool to explore the time scales and patterns on which material at the surface of the ocean disperses. You can either make screenshots/screencasts or, if you want, download the data from an experiment and analyse that data in e.g. python.

Answer the following questions:

a. What happens to material from the Dutch coastline?

b. In which ocean basing do you observe most cross-equatorial transport? Why is that?

c. Estimate the typical speed of the ocean currents dispersing the material in different ocean basins. What is the typical current speed in the Gulf Stream, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the Equatorial current, and in the interior of the subpolar and subtropical gyres?

d. The website is based on the transition matrix approach to transport modelling, what (coastal, 3D, ...) processes could be missing?
