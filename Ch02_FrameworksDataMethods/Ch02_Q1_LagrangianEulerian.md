A ship travels with 10 km/h to the north. The surface air pressure increases with 5 Pa every km in the north-western direction. At the ship, a decrease of 100 Pa every 3 hours is measured. The pressure gradient remains constant in time. 

Use the material derivative of pressure:
Dp/Dt = ∂p/∂t + u∂p/∂x + v∂p/∂y + w∂p/∂z

a. Physically interpret each of the terms in the material derivative of the pressure.

b. What is the change in air pressure over the 3 hours at an island the ship passes? Is this an increase or a decrease?

c. What would be the pressure measured by a ship travelling due east?
