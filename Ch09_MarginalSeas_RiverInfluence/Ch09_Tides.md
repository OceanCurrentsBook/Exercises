Consider a boat on the Wadden Sea with a draught of 70cm (i.e. the deepest part of the hull reaches 70cm below the surface). The boat anchors around 9:30 at a location where the sea floor is at -1.0m.

The highest water level at that location occurs at 9:00, with a water level at +0.5m. The subsequent low tide occurs at 15:13 with a water level of -1.5m. The next high tide occurs at 21:25 with a water level of +0.5m.

a. What can you say about the tidal constituents that are important in the Wadden Sea, based on his data?

b. Give for the period between the first high tide until the next high tide a formula for the water depth at the location of the boat. Make use of a sine and/or a cosine function.

c. At what time does the boat get stuck on the sea floor? And at what time is it possible to walk around the boat?

The boat spends the low tide stuck on the sea floor. To avoid damage, it is wise to have about 30cm between the boat and the sea floor when leaving.

d. At what time can the boat leave?
